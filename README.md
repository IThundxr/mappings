# mappings

A project for building a documentation site and "mapping bundles" for [takenaka](https://github.com/zlataovce/takenaka).

## Building

If you want to build specific documentation/mapping bundle versions for yourself, you should:

1. Fork this repository
2. Enable workflows of forked repositories (click the Actions tab, and you'll see a popup).
3. Change things that have a `change me` comment in [build.gradle.kts](https://github.com/zlataovce/mappings/blob/master/build.gradle.kts).
4. Set the GitHub Pages target to the `gh-pages` branch.
5. Profit!
